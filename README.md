## Facebook introduces emoticons instead of "dislikes"

Facebook will finally fulfill the promise and expand the functions of the like button. Now it will be added as many as seven emoticons expressing a variety of emotions from the published post.

 

Earlier, Mark Zuckerberg reported on the development of a button expressing the “dislike” of the post. Users are waiting for its appearance almost from the day the social network was founded. However, instead of it, “reactions” will appear (Reactions) - that is the name of the developed function. The news highlighted the resource Engadget.com, citing employees of the company as a source of information.

The usual "like" with it does not go anywhere. By clicking on the button, network users will be able to mark their favorite entry as before. Or choose a smiley to express your reaction to the content of the tape.

Engadget also posted a screenshot of emoticons. The images convey the following emotions: love, laughter, smile, surprise, sadness and anger. Residents of Spain and Ireland are luckier than others - they will be able to try out the "reaction" today - October 9th. The function will spread to other regions a bit later. There will also be involved the audience of the service for business communications Pages. Advertising services, however, will continue to consider the function as a "like".

Opportunities to put Dislike to the post social network users have been waiting for more than one year. The creator of Facebook in this confirmed that the company is working on a similar function and its appearance should be expected in the near future.

Mark Zuckerberg also noted in his speech in December last year that the currently available functionality does not allow responding adequately to the content of the recording. It looks unnatural when you mark a post you like, and it talks about a social or cultural problem, loss and loss. The audience can express their emotions and show a real reaction thanks to a new feature. The developers have tried to display the full range of emotions in Reactions.

From the statement of Zuckerberg, then it was concluded about the introduction of the long-awaited users "dislayka". However, the creator of the network has more than once stated that he will not introduce a button that allows him to directly “dislike” posts. He also identified several reasons why he wants to do this.

First of all, it would make Facebook similar to a number of online forums, the principle of which is based on the UGC model of online media. Putting “Like / Dislike” marks in such a system would reduce or increase the rating.

The second reason Zuckerberg called the reluctance to distribute the negative. It is more than enough in social networks, and more importantly - to prevent its appearance, and not to create tools for expressing discontent.

And the third reason is that it is not profitable for advertising. Not many companies would agree that posts with their products are subject to active “minus” by users.

Even after all this, Facebook users have not lost hope of the appearance of the “Dislink” button. The community of fans of this button currently has about 3.2 million participants. When there was an opportunity to sign the petition, it was supported by almost 1, 5 million people.

Resource Fast Company is a different opinion from the creator of Facebook. The button would allow to mark negative events, expressing solidarity with this mark. And companies that would serve as a criterion for evaluating their advertising campaign. And most importantly - with its help it would be possible to mark truly annoying posts.
